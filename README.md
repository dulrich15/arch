STEM focused "Civilization" game



## Basic Idea



A "civilization" type game designed to teach physics. You "unlock" facts 
and "discover" theories. Will need money to unlock certain facts (necessary 
to build an atom smasher, for example). Will need to direct inquiries to 
discover theories. Last step in discovery will be a short quiz.

Must fund research. Discovery of math "facts" are funded on a flat fee and 
meeting prior dependencies. Science research funds experiments with different 
costs. A certain number of experiments (with dependencies) are required to 
unlock a scientific "fact". 

The right combination of facts (both math and science) will discover a 
theory. Once the theory is in place, more funding (R&D) will develop 
technology which will feedback to science and improve prosperity.



## KPIs


Math
  May include philosophy here. Each "section" to be unlocked with a quiz.
  Required for science, technology, and prosperity.

  * Arithmetic & Algebra
  * Geometry & Calculus
  * Philosophy & Logic

Science
  Basic knowledge base for game. Primarily physics and chemistry. Each 
  "section" to be unlocked with a quiz. Dependencies will include both math 
  and technology. May include social sciences to support market efficiency 
  (like economics and law).

  * Physics & Astronomy
  * Chemistry & Geology
  * Social Sciences

Technology
  This is the means to create wealth to fund further activity. Applications
  for consumers (like iPhones) but also advances in investigation (like the
  telescope). Dependecies on science.

  * Consumer Products (generates money)
  * Research Tools (supports science)
  * Medical & Agriculture (improves prosperity)

Prosperity
  Measures market efficiency. Should include economic elements like credit,
  money, etc. Also involves factors related to government: law, military, 
  peace, liberty, etc. Must include communication instruments like writing, 
  postal service, internet, etc. Dependencies on science, technology and math.

  * Economic Development
  * Peace & Justice (antithesis of force and fraud)
  * Communication



## Modules


We start out "primitive". Math starts out with ability to count. Science starts
out with four elements. Technology starts out with fire and spear. Prosperity
starts with barter and village. Progress through four levels:

Archimedes
  Achievements include optics, hydraulics, the lever, astronomy and 
  precalculus. Acts as "intro to physics" level.

Newton
  Achievements include the laws of motion and the law of gravity. Basics in 
  heat and electricity. This takes us historically up to about 1800.

Maxwell
  Electromagnetism, thermodynamics and beginnings of atomic theory. Takes us 
  up to about 1900.

Einstein
  Modern physics, chemistry, internet. Only here can one get to the moon, 
  build an atom bomb or make an iPhone.



## Notes


Game should be constructed from the beginning to be expandable. Two reasons:

* Allow expansion at the end ("beyond Einstein"). Maybe the user community 
  can "add" further modules to incorporate new developments in science, etc.

* Allow expansion in the middle. The game should work with just a minimum
  backbone. Want ability to flesh out interactively with a plug-and-play
  approach: "Release early, release often". 

Could even market the additional material via expansion packs.
